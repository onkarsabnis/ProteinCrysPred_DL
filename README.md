# Protein Crystallization Propensity Prediction Using Deep Learning Approach

<!-- # Installations Needed -->

### Requirements (if using Anaconda)

1. Download Anaconda (64 bit) installer python3.x for linux : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
2. Run the installer : `bash Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh` and follow the instructions to install.
3. Install tensorflow-gpu: `conda install tensorflow-gpu`
4. Install imblearn: `conda install -c glemaitre imbalanced-learn`
5. Install sklearn: `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`
<!-- 
# Run the model in Train Mode
  `!CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=? python Train.py` -->
  
### Run the model on New Test file
  `!CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=? python Test.py`

You can change the input file in the code.

### Requirements (if using Google Colaboratory)

1. Clone this repository in Google Colab : `!git clone https://github.com/onkarsabnis/ProteinCrysPred_DL.git`
2. Go to approapriate directory using cd command
3. To run the model in evaluation mode, run the above command (New Test file one)

# To Train the entire Model

1. Protein sequences have to be saved in a fasta format similar to following format:

.>Seq1
MPKFYCDYCDTYLTHDSPSVRKTHCSGRKHKENVKDYYQKWMEEQAQSLIDKTTAAFQQG
where '>Seq1' represents the fasta id and the second line is the protein sequence.

2. Download the model files ( all files *.hdf5 and files *.json) by running the following command: <br />
`wget https://storage.entrydns.org/nextcloud/index.php/s/3ErNEaZiKp39x4N/download`

3. Run the following two commands after downloading the model files:
!unzip download
!rm download

4. To train the model on your own data, run the following command (Train.py and the fasta file have to be in the same directory):
$ !python Train.py <file.fasta>
